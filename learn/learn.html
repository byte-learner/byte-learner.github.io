				<p class="text"> I believe that learning is a journey. A journey through an open expanse that one may not know where it leads – sometimes you are fortunate enough to perceive an end destination. It is not always structured, I believe that it was really never meant to be. That even as we seek to learn, let our joy, excitement and sense of fulfilment be gained from the journey itself and not necessarily from the desired end goal. Take a pen – I much prefer a pencil –, take a notepad or iPad if you prefer, take a seat and take pleasure in gaining a new understanding each day.</p>
				<p>So why not join use on this journey</p>

				<p class="text">The site is geared towards curating the journeys that others have taken in developing their self learning skills. Bring some light to those still in the dark wishing ot start their journeys on learning something new. Whether this is how to create a website, machine learning, being a good photographer or laerning the intricacies of blogging</p>
